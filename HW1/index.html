<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
There are new items, such as diamonds and first aid kits. There is also an enemy. Platforms were also changed. There is a new stat called 'Health' too.

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This prototype has diamonds, first aid kits, and an enemy programmed to kill the player.

I learned how to build a game using JavaScript in Phaser.
The hardest part about building this game was learning all the functions in Phaser, especially adding physics to the various sprites and objects in the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Assets were downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce/raw/master/resources/tutorials/02%20Making%20your%20first%20game/phaser_tutorial_02.zip">here</a>. The background was resized and modified from an image found on <a href="https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=game%20background%20forest&qs=n&form=QBIR&sp=-1&pq=game%20background%20fores&sc=6-21&sk=&cvid=C46832244D6D4F5580930CA7CA3FE3D3">Bing Images</a> using Paint. I created some of the assets used in this game, such as the platforms.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This prototype closely resembles the a Phaser example that I used <a href="http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-2-game">here</a>.
