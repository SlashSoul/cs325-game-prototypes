<h2>Lost Souls</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<ul>
  <li>Lost Souls is a Point-and-Click Platformer Game.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<ul>
  <li>Has a parallax background</li>
  <li>Enemies can move and kill the player</li>
  <li>Player can interact with other objects/enemies</li>
  <li>Sound effect to show a kill has been made</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<ul>
  <li>I learned how to animate the background, create enemies that can move, implement a weapons system, and implemented sound effects.</li>
  <li>The hardest part of this assignment was finding the proper assets to make this prototype. Often, I had to change them to fit the theme of the game.</li>
  <li>In addition, the animating and controlling movement of enemies required a lot of testing; so, the movements did not become predictable.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
