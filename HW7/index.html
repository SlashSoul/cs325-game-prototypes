<h2>Hero v3.0</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong> Hero v3.0 will have a level-based system (with varying configurations of objects for the bird to stand) and a click-based input, which is unlike any other game that I have built with Phaser.</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong> There is a strong emphasis on gravity and physics. It has to be managed correctly or the level will be difficult to beat.</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>What did you learn from this prototype? I learned how to use P2 physics, which is a lot more complicated than Arcade physics because game objects are treated as rectangular. Also, I learned how to create levels using multiple states. In addition, I learned a lot about placing game objects using create method's positioning instead of guessing randomly.</li>
	<li>What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? There was a bug with the left-click triggering event on a Phaser group of child game objects, but I fixed it now. The blocks of <span style="font-color: yellow">yellow</span> can be clicked and destroyed.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
	<ul>
		<li>The game design is similar to many mobile puzzle games.</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong> Hero v3.0 is a single-player puzzle platformer.</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong> N/A</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Input: Left-click Mouse</li>
		<li>Randomness: Deterministic</li>
		<li>Genre: Puzzle</li>
		<li>Play Style: Avoid removing obstacles that may cause the bird to fall to its death.</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong> This prototype is evaluating the enjoyment of click-based pointer games.</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong> Players should be able to understand the rules of this game easily and experience a sense of progression after completing levels.</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>Hero v3.0 is a single-input game: left-click. If the object is yellow, then the object will be destroyed if it is clicked. If the object is green, the object cannot be destroyed when it is clicked.</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong> The objective of this game is to remove all yellow objects without forcing the bird to fall down to its death and touch the ground. Beat level after level until there are no more levels.</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong> This game is set on mountainous terrain in the middle of the night. The bird finds itself stuck on bricks, and it needs your help removing the obstacles. The player will feel the tension of having to remove obstacles until there is no more without making the bird fall down and die.</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Ages 5+ & Puzzle Enthusiasts</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong> 1~2 minutes</li>
