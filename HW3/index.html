<h2>Sergeant Whiskers</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong> Sergeant Whiskers is a Flappy Bird-esque game where the player has three lives and collecting shirts to wash for the laundromat. There is also a way to win the game too.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong> This game has multiple game states: boot, preloader, main menu, and game. I have also learned how to implement a HP bar.</li>
<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>What did you learn from this prototype? I have gained a better understanding of creating and editing game states in Phaser.</li>
	<li>What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? This week's storymatic elements were difficult to put together. I also spent some time positioning text and sprites: making small changes and reloading the page is a time killer.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong> This game closely resembles <a href="http://www.lessmilk.com/tutorial/flappy-bird-phaser-1">Flappy Bird</a>.</li>
<li><strong>High Concept:</strong> Sergeant Whiskers needs your help to wash his clothes!</li>

	<li>Play Style: Avoid colliding with the walls, and collect the items to win the game.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong> This prototype is evaluating the game mechanic of progression. After the player has collected a number of shirts, then the game ends with a cutscene. A health mechanic has also been added.</li>
<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong> Have fun until they get bored.</li>
<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<ul>
